Practicing SQL Queries
============================

For this homework, I have prepared a MySQL database hosted on Amazon Web Services. Use the code below to connect to the database.


```r
library(DBI)
witch_con <- dbConnect(
  RMySQL::MySQL(),
  user = 'student',
  password = 'mds-is-fun',
  dbname = 'witchcraft',
  host = 'tbrambor.csbmzoea3lu9.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com',
  port = 3306
)

witch_con
```

```
## <MySQLConnection:0,0>
```

The data comes from a project on "Scottish Witchcraft" and contains all people known to have been accused of witchcraft in early modern Scotland. There is information on where and when they were accused, how they were tried, what their fate was etc.

>Julian Goodare, Lauren Martin, Joyce Miller and Louise Yeoman, ‘The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft’, http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Research/witches/) 

#### 1. Getting to know the data

a) Show a list of the tables included in the database.


```sql
-- dbListTables(witch_con)
SHOW TABLES
```


<div class="knitsql-table">


Table: Displaying records 1 - 10

|Tables_in_witchcraft |
|:--------------------|
|accused              |
|accused_family       |
|appeal               |
|calendarcustom       |
|case_person          |
|commission           |
|complaint            |
|confession           |
|counterstrategy      |
|demonicpact          |

</div>



b) Display the column names for the table `accused`.  


```sql
DESCRIBE accused
```


<div class="knitsql-table">


Table: Displaying records 1 - 10

Field             Type     Null   Key   Default   Extra 
----------------  -------  -----  ----  --------  ------
row_names         text     YES          NA              
accusedref        text     YES          NA              
accusedsystemid   text     YES          NA              
accusedid         double   YES          NA              
firstname         text     YES          NA              
lastname          text     YES          NA              
m_firstname       text     YES          NA              
m_surname         text     YES          NA              
alias             text     YES          NA              
patronymic        text     YES          NA              

</div>

c) How many people are included in the accused table?  


```sql

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM accused

```


<div class="knitsql-table">


Table: 1 records

|COUNT(*) |
|:--------|
|3219     |

</div>
d) Display the columns `firstname`, `sex`, and `age` for 5 cases in the `accused` table. 


```sql
SELECT firstname, sex, age 
FROM accused

```


<div class="knitsql-table">


Table: Displaying records 1 - 10

firstname   sex       age
----------  -------  ----
Mareon      Female     NA
Thom        Male       NA

Margaret    Female     NA
Janet       Female     50
Agnes       Female     NA
Marion      Female     NA

</div>
c) Looks like the `age` is missing for some observations. Count the number of nonmissing values for age in the data.  

```sql
SELECT COUNT(age)
FROM accused;

```


<div class="knitsql-table">


Table: 1 records

|COUNT(age) |
|:----------|
|166        |

</div>
d) Show a list of unique `occupation`s.


```sql

SELECT DISTINCT occupation
FROM accused

```


<div class="knitsql-table">


Table: Displaying records 1 - 10

|occupation |

|Weaver     |
|Midwife    |
|Tailor     |
|Messenger  |
|Brewster   |
|Smith      |
|Minister   |

</div>

#### 2. Seeing the Devil

Let's look at some appearances of the devil in the `devilappearance` table.

a) List the unique `devil_type`s in the data.  

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT devil_type
FROM devilappearance
```


<div class="knitsql-table">


Table: Displaying records 1 - 10

|devil_type   |
|:------------|
|Male         |
|Female Fairy |
|Male Fairy   |
|Animal Devil |
|Spirit       |
|Ghost        |
|Other Demon  |
|Female       |
|NA           |
|Fairy        |

</div>

b) There is also a little description of the type of the devil sighting in the `devil_text`
column. How many of the sightings mention the word "black" in the description?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM devilappearance
WHERE devil_text LIKE ('%black%')
```


<div class="knitsql-table">


Table: 1 records

|COUNT(*) |
|:--------|
|121      |

</div>


c) What proportion of the devils (in `devil_type`) are male? 

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM devilappearance
WHERE devil_type IN ('Male')

```


<div class="knitsql-table">


Table: 1 records

|COUNT(*) |
|:--------|
|250      |

</div>


#### 3. The trial

Let's take a look at the information on the `trial`.


```sql
DESCRIBE trial

```


<div class="knitsql-table">


Table: Displaying records 1 - 10

Field              Type     Null   Key   Default   Extra 
-----------------  -------  -----  ----  --------  ------
row_names          text     YES          NA              
trialref           text     YES          NA              
trialid            double   YES          NA              
trialsystemid      text     YES          NA              
caseref            text     YES          NA              
trialtype          double   YES          NA              
trial_settlement   text     YES          NA              
trial_parish       text     YES          NA              
trial_presbytery   text     YES          NA              
trial_county       text     YES          NA              

</div>

a) What are the average and maximum numbers of male and female accusers?

```sql
SELECT AVG(female_accusers), MAX(female_accusers)
FROM trial;
```


<div class="knitsql-table">


Table: 1 records

AVG(female_accusers)    MAX(female_accusers)
---------------------  ---------------------
0.255922693266833                         27

</div>


```sql

SELECT AVG(male_accusers), MAX(male_accusers)
FROM trial;
```


<div class="knitsql-table">


Table: 1 records

AVG(male_accusers)    MAX(male_accusers)
-------------------  -------------------
0.418198815830477                     48

</div>


b) Count the number of `sentence`s by sentence type. List them in a table (in descending order), excluding missing values. Rename the column headings to something sensible.

```sql
SELECT sentence, COUNT(*)
FROM trial
GROUP BY sentence 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
```




```r
mydataframe
```

```
##              sentence COUNT(*)
## 1                <NA>     2904
## 2           Execution      205
## 3            Released       52
## 4          Banishment       27
## 5   Declared Fugitive       11
## 6      Excommunicated        6
## 7     Put to the horn        2
## 8                Hang        1
## 9             Branded        1
## 10             Prison        1
## 11 Public Humiliation        1
```



c) Do the number of accusers matter for the `verdict`? Compare the average number of accusers by the type of verdict. Again make sure the table is sorted and the headings make sense. 


```sql
SELECT AVG(female_accusers+male_accusers)
FROM trial
GROUP BY verdict

```


<div class="knitsql-table">


Table: 5 records

| AVG(female_accusers+male_accusers)|
|----------------------------------:|
|                          5.8042553|
|                          0.2013054|
|                          4.5581395|
|                          1.0000000|
|                          0.2857143|

</div>





#### 4. Tortured Truth (Bonus)

_Note: This part is optional. We spent little time on joins in lecture, so I encourage you to try it but feel free to skip._

a) Left join the `trial` and `confession` tables. For what share of trials does the database record confessions? Create a results table with the number of all trials, the number of confessions, and the share of trials with confessions recorded.
>  


```sql
SELECT *
FROM trial LEFT JOIN confession 
ON trial.row_names=confession.row_names;
```



```r
trial_dim  = dim(mydataframe)
trial_row = trial_dim[1]
conf_total = sum (!is.na(mydataframe$confessionref))
share = conf_total/trial_dim[1]
print(share)
```

```
## [1] 0.2930551
```

```r
tb <- matrix(c(trial_row, conf_total, share))
rownames(tb) <- c("number_of_trials", "number_of_confessions", "share_of_trials")
tb <- as.table(tb)
tb
```

```
##                                  A
## number_of_trials      3211.0000000
## number_of_confessions  941.0000000
## share_of_trials          0.2930551
```


```sql
SELECT *
FROM torture
```

</div>



b) Only a small number of trials have records of torture. Is there a higher share of confessions among trials with records of torture than trials without such record? _Hint:_ You will need to merge on the `confession` table. 

> If joinning the all trial, torture, and confession tables, there are 110 records of confessions which is 0.034 of all the trials. In comparison with trial table without torture, there were 941 records of confession which was 0.29 of all the trial records.


```sql
SELECT *
FROM trial 
LEFT JOIN torture ON trial.row_names=torture.row_names
LEFT JOIN confession ON torture.row_names=confession.row_names

```



```r
#mydataframe
trail_dim  <- dim(mydataframe)
conf_num <- sum(!is.na(mydataframe$confessionrec))
share_2 = conf_num/trial_dim[1]
print(share_2)
```

```
## [1] 0.03425724
```

```r
tb_2 <- matrix(c(trial_row, conf_num, share_2))
rownames(tb_2) <- c("number_of_trials", "number_of_confessions", "share_of_trials")
