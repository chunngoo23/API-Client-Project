# Stashing
Saving your changes aside first, and pull from the origin first. And then come to your changes later.

# Rebasing
While you are developing your branch base on a  point, the master is still developing, your changes should be rebased on the new base on the master branch.

```{r}
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('addinslist')
library(tidyverse)
```

# Troubleshooting
While asking for debugging, give others the original code.
package reprex to reproduce the error

# The  %>% operator

# Filter versus base R  selecting data
base R function  of selecting will select the m issing data  as well

# dplyr ::select()
You have different  options of arguments to select the data you want, but you can also use regular expression to select them.

# dplyr functions
Functions in dplyr are mostly mapping to SQL and can even be linkedin and mapped to SQL

# tidyr
When doing accessing data, using number or name, thinking in the way that if you slightly modify the dataframe, can you still access the data with the way you accessed it.

# tidyr
When imagining/planning for reforming the dataframe, think about your ID  key.


This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
