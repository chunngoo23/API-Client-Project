The goal of Envelope is to help you easily, reasonably, and fairly calculate how much should each child in each family receive in their envelope during Chinese New Year.

## Installation

You can install the released version of Envelope from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: devtools::install_github()

``` r
install.packages("Envelope")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("QMSS-G5072-2019/Lai_Ting_An")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}

envelope (2, 4)
```
